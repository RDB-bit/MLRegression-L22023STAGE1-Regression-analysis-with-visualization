# MLRegression-L22023STAGE1-Regression-analysis-with-visualization


This repository provides code examples and resources for performing regression analysis with a focus on visualization.

**INRTODUCTION**
The purpose of this repository is to provide a guide to regression analysis with a strong emphasis on visualization techniques. It covers the fundamentals of regression analysis using various regression techniques.

The main objective is to demonstrate how visualization can be used to gain insights from regression models, identify patterns, assess model fit, and communicate findings effectively. The code examples are implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
